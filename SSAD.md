# Dijkstra's Shortest Paths Algorithm (SSAD)


## Introduction/Background
**Project description:** An implementation of Dijkstra's shortest paths alogrithm of a weighted graph. It is a program that takes in a weighed graph text file and returns an output file of all adjacent nodes for each node and the shortest path from the starting node to any other node.


Project #5 for my Data Structures and Algorithms class in Spring 2021. It was the final project for the class. This assignment put a focus on being able to translate the algorithm into code and the use of a heap for efficiency.

This was a project for Data Structures and Algorithms class in Spring 2021. Due to honor code I am unable to show the code publically. If you wish to see it, please reach out to my email brnguyen2017@gmail.com
